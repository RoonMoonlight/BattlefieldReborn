# Battlefield Reborn
The classic Battlefield 4 style you've been waiting for! Battlefield Reborn is the project to replicate the Battlefield 4 gameplay into Battlefield 2042.

### Features
* **Own map rotations** - Less popular and problematic maps are removed, now you don't need to be stressful because of worst map design
* **More teamplay is required** - Specialist has been always controversy for fans who prefer team-based game, so because of that we made following changes to punish the player who doesn't do teamwork very well:
   * You keep the specialist feature - but character gadgets are disabled, and based purely on your skill.
   * While you die, no one can revive you except support specialists. Support specialists are now most important class on your team, so take care of them!
   * You keep the traits, so you have at least one difference per each specialists.
   * Boris, Rao, Crawford are disabled due to trait similarity. They will be added later when they get new traits in the future update.
* **Aim Assist is disabled**
* And more will come in the later updates. Stay tuned!
